## Javascript Notes

- Javascript is the layer of a webpage where you can change how the page behaves.
- HTML is the content and CSS is the presentation. You start with the HTML, then add CSS then add Javascript to enhance the usability of the site.

- When you want to use JavaScript with a webpage use the HTML tag `<script>` to tell the browser it is coming across a script. The `src` attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

- Most of the scripts are added before the `</body>` tag.

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript files. These are text files like HTML and CSS style sheets but they have the .js extension.
