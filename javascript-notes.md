## Javascript Notes

- JavaScript is an asynchronous language designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive.

HTML is the structure of the site and CSS is what  makes the webpage beautiful. Javascript is what makes a webpage interactive for users. 

- When you want to use JavaScript with a webpage use the HTML tag `<script>` to tell the browser it is coming across a script. The `src` attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

- Most of the scripts are added before the `</body>` tag.

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript files. These are text files like HTML and CSS style sheets but they have the .js extension.
