# Process and Design (Chapter 18)

When creating a website you must conisder a few things:
* Who is this website for?
* Why will people be visiting your website?
    * What are the underlying motivations of visitors?
    * What are the specific goals of the visitors?
* What are your visitors trying to achieve?
* What information do your visitors need?
* How often will people visit your site?

After deciding what needs to appear on your website, you need to organize the information into sections or pages. This can be done using a **site map**.

* A **site map** is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This shows how the pages will be grouped. 
* A **site map** usually begins with a homepage, and the other pages are compartmentalized into sections that are linked to the homepage.

* A **wirefram** is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of information and how much space it might require.

### Design

* Webpages contain a lot of content that need to be organized and prioritized.

* **Visual Hierarchy** refers to the order in which your eyes percieve what they see. It is created by adding **visual contrast** between items being displayed, the items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first. Visual hierarchy helps to get the visitor's attention on the important stuff using size, color, and style.
* Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first.

* **Grouping** related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.

* **Navigation** helps people find where they want to go on your site and how your site works.
