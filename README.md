### Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is one in which you believe that your fundamental abilities can be further developed through perserverence and effort
- Remember to learn from criticism.
  - Learning from you're own mistakes helps you not to make them again!
* Remember to embrace challenges.
  - You will come out with a better understanding!
- Remember to persist through obstacles.
  - There is always a lesson to be learned within them!
  
 ### Markdown
 
Markdown is a way of styling text on a webpage, with markdown you can:
* Make text __bold__ or _italic_
* Add images
* Make lists (just like this one I've made right here!) 
  - To make a bulleted list use "-" or "*" 
  - To make a ordered list use either "1." or label each line in ascending order (1., 2., 3., etc.)
  - To create subpoints (just like this one!) add two spaces before your dash, star, or number.
###### With markdown you can add headers of any size, just add "#" before any text. The more "#" signs you add the more the size will become 
##### larger...
### and larger...
## and even larger...
# until your header is the size you want!
