### How to **Succeed**? Prepare to **Fail**!
* Path Learning = Exchange of Information
* Sandbox Learning = Learning by Discovery

### Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is one in which you believe that your fundamental abilities can be further developed through perserverence and effort
+ Remember to learn from criticism.
  - Learning from you're own mistakes helps you not to make them again!
* Remember to embrace challenges.
  - You will come out with a better understanding!
- Remember to persist through obstacles.
  - There is always a lesson to be learned within them!
  
 ### Markdown
 
Markdown is a way of styling text on a webpage, with markdown you can:
* Make text __bold__ or _italic_
  - ***You can combine both of these and have some fun!***
* Make lists (just like this one I've made right here!) 
  - To make a bulleted list use '-' or '*' 
  - To make a ordered list use either '1.' or label each line in ascending order (1., 2., 3., etc.)
  - To create subpoints (just like this one!) add two spaces before your dash, star, or number.
  - You can also make a task list by using '- [ ]' for an unfisinished task aned '- [x]' for a completed task.
    - [ ] Walk the dog
    - [ ] Do the Dishes
    - [X] Sleep in
###### With markdown you can add headers of any size, just add '#' before any text. The more '#' signs you add you will see the size become 
##### larger...
### and larger...
## and even larger...
# until your header is the size you want!

### How to add images:
* To add a image with Markdown add the name of the image and URL into this syntax '''![Alt Text]+(url)'''
* For example if I wanted to add a cute picture of a cat to this page I would put:

        '![Cute Kitty](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/cat_weight_other/1800x1200_cat_weight_other.jpg?resize=600px:*)'

and it would result in:

![Cute Kitty](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/cat_weight_other/1800x1200_cat_weight_other.jpg?resize=600px:*)

### Using Quoted Text:
  A lot of people have said some pretty quotable things, so it's important to know how to incorporate that with Markdown. 
  To use blockquotes simply put a '>' before every line of quoted text.
 
 *Albert Einstein once said:*
>The difference between stupidity and genius 
>is that genius has its limits.

### How to Create a Table with Markdown:
If you want a table on your website you need two things, a hyphen '-' and a pipe '|'. With these use the syntax code:

        First Header | Second Header
        ------------ | -------------
        Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
        Content in the first column | Content in the second column
        
Add whatever content you want and you should get something like this:

## Should I Eat Some Ice Cream?

__Pros__ | __Cons__
-----|------
It tastes awesome|It might make me sick
Its super delicious|A moment on the lips, forever on the hips
I deserve a treat|I can't think of any more, I'm going to eat it

### Strikethrough
If you need to cross something out in a web page use the good ol' tilde ('~' This squiggly guy)
Simply put the two tildes on either side of the text like so:
        ~~I don't like this sentence so I'm striking through it~~
