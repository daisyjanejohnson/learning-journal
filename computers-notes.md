## How Computers Work

### What makes a computer a computer?:
- Computers were built as a tool to help "thinking work, and designed to manipulate information.
- Had to perform 4 different tasks:
    1. **Take input**
        - The stuff that the world does, or you do that makes the computer do stuff. Ex.) a Touch screen recognizing your finger and activating.
    1. **Store information** 
        - Inputs gives a computer information, which is then stored in memory. 
    1. **Process it**
        - A computer's processor takes the information from memory and manipulates it or "changes it" usin an algorithm which is just a series of commands. It then sends the processed info back to be stored and this continues until the information is ready to be output.
    1. **Output results**
        - How the computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do. Ex.) a computer display can show text, videos, pictures, or games.
- Started out as basic calcuators, now they can do limitless things.

### Data and Binary
- In side a computer there are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer. The electricity running through a wire can either be on or off. With one wire it can be on or off which can mean yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0, or anything else with only two options. 
This on/off state of a single wire is called a **bit**, it is the smallest piece of information a computer can store. With more wires you can store more bits thus more information.
- Binary Number System
    - Two digits, 0 and 1
    - Any number can be represented, you store them on the wires and the more wires the bigger the numbers you can store. 

### Circuits and Logic

- Every input or output from a computer is a type of information which can be represented with on or off electrical signals. To combine all of the signals in order to get an output a comuter uses a lot of tiny electronic components which come together to form **circuits**.
- A circuit that adds 2 bits together is called an **adder**, the adder combines the information to come up with a sum. The more adders, the larger numbers you can add.
- Everything you do with technology requires lots of information to be processed extremely quickly. This is accomplished by circuits that turn binary signals into websites, videos, pictures and games.

### CPU, Memory, Input and Output.

Once again computers do 4 things: Take input from the physical world, storing and processing that information, and outputting results back into the physical world. This is done with the CPU and memory. 
- Input devices consist of things like a computer keyboard, touchpad of a phone, microphone, or even a thermostat sensor.
When you press a key on your keyboard (let's say the letter `H`), the keyboard converts the letter to a number. The number is sent as binary into the computer.
- CPU calculates how to display the letter `H` pixel by pixel. CPU request step by step directions from Memory to learn how to draw the leter `H`. The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.
- The pixel information is sent in binary to the screen, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors you see. 

### Hardware and Software

- **Hardware**: All of the things you see inside a computng device such as circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, etc.
- **Software**: All of the things you don't see. The computer programs, or code, running on the machine. Can be anything from apps and games, to web pages.

#### How does the Hardware and Software interact together?

- **CPU** (Central Processing Unit): The master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. It has circuits to do math and logic, and circuits to send and recieve information to and from other parts of the computer.
It recieves simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a certain job. Example: 
    - An `add` command tells the CPU to use its outer circuit to calculate a new number.
    - The `store` command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into memory
- Binary code is the most baisc form of software and it controls all the hardware of a computer. Programming languages (like JavaScript or Python) allows you type in commands that look a lot like english, this high level comman is converted into hundreds, or thousands, of simpler binary commands that the CPU understands.
- **Operating System**: The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It has special abilities that allows it to control other software on a computer. It decides when the CPU can run a program and whther that program can access the computers input and output devices.
    - When multiple software programs are running the operating system is quickly switching programs, sharing the CPU between them for fractions of a second.
