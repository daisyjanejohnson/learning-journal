## How Computers Work

### What makes a computer a computer?:
- Computers were built as a tool to help "thinking work, and designed to manipulate information.
- Had to perform 4 different tasks:
    1. **Take input**
        - The stuff that the world does, or you do that makes the computer do stuff. Ex.) a Touch screen recognizing your finger and activating.
    1. **Store information** 
        - Inputs gives a computer information, which is then stored in memory. 
    1. **Process it**
        - A computer's processor takes the information from memory and manipulates it or "changes it" usin an algorithm which is just a series of commands. It then sends the processed info back to be stored and this continues until the information is ready to be output.
    1. **Output results**
        - How the computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do. Ex.) a computer display can show text, videos, pictures, or games.
- Started out as basic calcuators, now they can do limitless things.

### Data and Binary
- In side a computer there are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer. The electricity running through a wire can either be on or off. With one wire it can be on or off which can mean yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0, or anything else with only two options. 
This on/off state of a single wire is called a **bit**, it is the smallest piece of information a computer can store. With more wires you can store more bits thus more information.
- Binary Number System
    - Two digits, 0 and 1
    - Any number can be represented, you store them on the wires and the more wires the bigger the numbers you can store. 

### Circuits and Logic

- Every input or output from a computer is a type of information which can be represented with on or off electrical signals. To combine all of the signals in order to get an output a comuter uses a lot of tiny electronic components which come together to form **circuits**.
