### Comparison and Logical Operators.
- **Comparison Operators**: You can evaluate a situation by comparing one calue in the script to what you might expect it to be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.
- `==`: Is equal to. This operator compares two calues (numbers, strings or Booleans) to see if they are the same.
- `===`: Strict equal to. This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
- `!=`: Is not equal to. This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same.
- `!==` Strict not equal to. This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.
- **Evaluating**: The testing or checking of a condition.
- `>`: Greater than. This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
- `<`: Less than. This oprator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
- `>=`: 
- `<=`: Less than or equal to. This operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
- `+=`: Sum total. Adds something to a variable and keeps adding it.
**Logical operators**: allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
-`&&`: Logical and. This operator tests more than one condition. (If both expressions evaluate to true, then the expression returns true. If just one of these returns false, then the expression will return false.)
- `||`: Logical or. This operator tests at least one condition.(If either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true. If both return false, then the expression will return false.)
-`!`: Logical not. This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.(`!true returns false` `!false returns true`)

### For and While loops.
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.
- `FOR`: Loop used to run code a specific amount of times. The condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
- `WHILE`: Loop used if you do not know how many times the code should run. (BASED OFF OF TRUE OR FALSE) Here the condition can be something other than a counter and the code will continue to run for as long as the condition is true.
- `DO WHILE`: The do...while loops is similar to the WHILE loop but it always runs the swtatements inside the curly braces at leasr once, even if the condition evaluates it to be false.
