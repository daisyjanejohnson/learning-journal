### Script
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Scripts are like recipes.
- To write a script you need to:
    1. Define the goal.
    1. Design the script.
    3. Code each step.
 -**Vocabulary**: The words that computers understand.
 -**Syntax**: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.
 - **Programmatically**: Follow a series of instructions one after another.

 ### Expressions and Operators

 - An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
    1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
    1. Ecpressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
- Expressions rely on **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
    1. Assignment operators: Assign a value to a variable. Ex. `color = 'beige';`
    1. Comparison operators: Compare two values and return true or false. Ex.) `buy = 3 > 5;`
- The one string operator is the `+` symbol, used to join the strings on either side of it.

### Functions
- **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
    - To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a **function declaration**.
- **Calling** the function: When you ask a function to perform its task.
- **Parameters**: Pieces of information passed to a function.
- **Return Value**: The response when you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer.
