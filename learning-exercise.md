## What the exercise in Lab 03 taught me

* When using Git and Github it is very important to save changes after every change.
* In order to confirm any changes made you need to use the A-C-P method. Add, Commit, Push.
```
git add linkurl
git commit -m "reason for change" 
git push origin master
```
* If you do this after making edits on any code on a page in VS code then you will have successfully stored the changes you have made locally and online to Github.

* It is important to often use `git status` to check if there are any files that need to be saved. `git status` should be the go to if you are lost.

* Read your code over multiple times to ensure there are no typos, then go to the live url to check that evrything works and looks the way you want.
