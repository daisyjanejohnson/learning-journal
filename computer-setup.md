## Command Line Prompts

A command line (a.k.a. Terminal) is a text based interface to the system. You enter commands by typing them out and you recieve feedback similarily through text.
Here is a link to a great website with a list of CMD commands: [CMD Commands](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Cmd_commands_under_Windows) 

- Within a terminal you have a **shell**. This is the part of the OS that defines how the terminal will behave and run commands for you. The most common shell is **bash**. To input this into your terminal 
- **Relative Path**: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system. Does not begin with a slash.
- **Absolute Path**: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system. Always begins with a forward slash (/).

# Commands:
- `echo` = a command to display a system variable stating your shell.
- `pwd` = "Print Working Directory", This command tells you what your current working directory is.
- `ls` = "List", This command tells you what is in your current directory.
- `cd` = "Change Directory", This command changes your location. To go to a specific location do cd [location]
